## Robotics Simulation & Digital Twin Engineer

📍 Spain  
🌍 Remote-friendly

I help robotics teams and companies build simulation and digital-twin infrastructure they can actually trust — so they can test faster, reduce risk, and make real decisions before touching hardware.

I work at the intersection of robotics, physics-based simulation, 3D engines and distributed systems, designing the technical foundations that make complex robotic systems testable, debuggable and scalable.

## What I specialize in

- Robotics simulation and digital twins
- Physics engines and simulation fidelity
- 3D graphics and rendering from a **programming and systems** perspective
- Integration of simulators with distributed control systems
- Communication layers between simulators, middleware and real robots
- ROS 2 system description and integration
- Unreal Engine–based simulation and VR interaction

My work focuses on infrastructure-level software: the systems that enable robotics engineers to move faster **without breaking things**.
