# Sergio Eslava

Robotics software engineer specialized in **robotics simulation, graphics engines and physics-based systems**, with a strong focus on the technical foundations that make complex robotic systems reliable and testable.

📍 Spain  
🌍 Open to remote work

I work at the intersection of **robotics, simulation, 3D graphics and distributed systems**, building simulators, communication layers and tooling that bridge real robots, physics engines and control software.

---

## What I specialize in

- Robotics simulation and digital twins
- Physics engines and simulation fidelity
- 3D graphics and rendering from a **programming and systems** perspective
- Integration of simulators with distributed control systems
- Communication layers between simulators, middleware and real robots
- ROS 2 system description and integration
- Unreal Engine–based simulation and VR interaction

I’m particularly interested in building **infrastructure-level software**: the systems that robotics engineers rely on to test, validate and operate robots in realistic environments.
